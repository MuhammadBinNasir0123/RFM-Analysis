# 📊 RFM Customer Segmentation Analysis  

## 📝 Project Overview  
This project applies **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** modeling on retail transactional data to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. The goal was to uncover distinct customer groups and recommend **targeted marketing strategies** for retention and growth.  

---

## 🔑 Key Insights  
- Analyzed **5,860 customers** from **800,000+ transactions**  
- Discovered **7 customer segments** using RFM scoring  
- **Top 5 customers** contributed **$1.9M+ revenue**  
- Identified **615 high-value customers** at risk of churn

## 👥 Customer Segments Discovered  

| Segment             | Customers | Priority   | Description |
|---------------------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| At Risk Customers   | 1,470     | 🔴 High    | Recent but infrequent buyers needing re-engagement |
| Potential Loyalists | 1,430     | 🟡 Medium  | Moderate recency and frequency with growth potential |
| Lost Customers      | 842       | ⚫ Low     | Inactive customers requiring win-back campaigns |
| Champions           | 720       | 🟢 High    | Best customers: recent, frequent, high spenders |

| Loyal Customers     | 506       | 🟡 Medium  | Frequent buyers but not necessarily recent |
| New Customers       | 123       | 🟡 Medium  | Recently acquired customers |

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation
# RFM Calculation
rfm = df_clean.groupby('Customer ID').agg({
    'InvoiceDate': lambda x: (snapshot_date - x.max()).days,  # Recency
    'Invoice': 'nunique',                                    # Frequency
    'TotalSales': 'sum'                                      # Monetary
}).reset_index()

rfm.columns = ['CustomerID', 'Recency', 'Frequency', 'Monetary']
